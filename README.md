# Academic Notebook Cloud Platform

A comprehensive cloud-based academic notebook platform that addresses key research gaps in collaborative academic note-taking and management.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This platform solves critical limitations identified in current research:

1. **Real-time Collaboration** - Multi-user editing with conflict resolution
2. **Active Backup & Auto-Archiving** - Continuous versioning with instant rollback
3. **Academic-Focused Features** - Role-based access, contribution tracking, grading integration
4. **Cross-Platform Support** - Consistent experience across all devices and operating systems
5. **AI-Powered Organization** - Intelligent search and content discovery

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Cloud Infrastructure (AWS)
- **S3**: Document storage with versioning
- **DynamoDB**: Metadata and user management
- **Lambda**: Serverless processing and triggers
- **CloudFront**: Global CDN for performance
- **Cognito**: Authentication and authorization
- **OpenSearch**: AI-powered search and indexing

### Application Stack
- **Frontend**: React/Next.js with real-time collaboration
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express and AWS SDK
- **Deployment**: Docker + Kubernetes (EKS)
- **Security**: End-to-end encryption (TLS + storage)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- Docker
- AWS CLI configured
- kubectl (for Kubernetes deployment)

### Installation
```bash
# Clone and install dependencies

## 🔬 Research Gap Analysis

This project directly addresses limitations from recent academic research:

### Paper 1: Cloud-Based Note Sharing (ResearchGate, 2023)
**Gap**: "Did not address real-time collaboration or active backups"
**Solution**: Implemented continuous backup with Lambda triggers and real-time WebSocket collaboration

### Paper 2: Distributed Notebook Architecture (ACM, 2024)
**Gap**: "Lacked academic focus, especially backup and version tracking for coursework"
**Solution**: Academic-specific versioning, metadata tracking, and grading integration

### Paper 3: Laboratory Notebook in 21st Century (ResearchGate, 2014)
**Gap**: "Not focused on distributed, multi-user academic collaboration"
**Solution**: Multi-user resilient platform with role-based access and collaboration analytics

## 🔐 Security Features

- AWS Cognito authentication
- Role-based access control (Student, Teacher, Researcher)
- End-to-end encryption
- Audit logging and compliance

## 📊 Key Features

- **Continuous Versioning**: Every change automatically saved and versioned
- **Real-time Collaboration**: Multiple users editing simultaneously
- **Cross-platform Support**: Web, mobile, and desktop compatibility
- **AI-powered Search**: Natural language queries across all content
- **Academic Workflows**: Grading, plagiarism detection, contribution analysis
- **Offline Support**: Local caching with sync when online

## 📈 Scalability

- Containerized deployment with Kubernetes
- Auto-scaling based on usage
- Global CDN for optimal performance
- Microservices architecture for independent scaling
